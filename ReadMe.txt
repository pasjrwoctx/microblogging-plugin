Microblogging-plugin, was created out of desire to add a kind of live status feed to my site, 
This code is very convoluted, I Am Not A Programmer,  I did the best I could and used a lot of help from 
Microsoft's Copilot Ai, to get it together and working, I make no promise of this code being of any 
value, and I take no responsibility if it breaks your website, to the best of my knowledge this code 
is unique to my application, using various open-source code bits from all over the programming world, 
This code will never be updated nor maintained by me. Use at your own risk, and feel free to alter and
make your own, providing it remains a full open-sourced plugin, sorry but dont ask how it works,
I dont understand how I got it together in the first place.
